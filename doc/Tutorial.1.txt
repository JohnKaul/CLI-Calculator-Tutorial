Developing a taste for Meat and Potatoes : Tutorial 1 : Scope and Directory

There is a quote from a famous developer that says: "The world doesn't live off jam and fancy perfumes - it lives off bread and meat and potatoes. Nothing changes. All the big fancy stuff is sloppy stuff that crashes. I don't need dancing baloney - I need stuff that works. That's not as pretty, and just as hard." ~ Theo de Raadt

This specific quote comes from a discussion about having release ready code all the time--everyday--but the undertone to this quote was about other companies failure to be able to release on a set schedule because of the fancy "bling" they want in each new release and there is something to say about the strength behind the basics.

I'd like to guide you down the development of a simple calculator tool; this tool will be a simple command line calculator. We will be documenting every (most) aspects of creating this tool and this tutorial will be an introduction into the C based languages (we will be using C/C++ for this simple program).

You will learn:
* Flexible directory structure.
* Some basic tools used by all programmers.
* Simple programming skills/methods.
* Introduction into low level languages and objects.

WARNING:
I said `simple calculator' but that's not really where this project will end up after we get coding; almost right away (in tutorial 6/7/8) we will be adding in a small scale parser. The calculator concept will offer simplified parsing concepts that should keep the code to a minimum -i.e. a calculator usually only handles numbers and what not so our parser doesn't have to be overly complicated but will still contain the basics behind all parsers.

Directory structure:
We need a flexible (professional) directory structure and the following is a copy/abridged/modification of the LLVM directory structure which is by far the best I have ever used/made.

Why is this important? Keeping things organized will help you understand how your compiler works later and how to add tools to your development. And, this direcotry structure will support third party tools to be intergrated easly into your projects. 

This is the directory structure we will be using.

Scope: 
The scope of this calculator will be to parse command line arguments and preform the calculation. This will adjust as we get more complicated.

Schedule:
I'm trying to balance a busy work and family life as I type these tutorials so I don't plan on submitting these on a daily basis but I do hope these tutorials will start to take on a life of they're own as we get the introductions over with.
