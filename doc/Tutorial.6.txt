Tutorial 6: Ready, Set, Go!

Let's create a program.

Place the CMakeLists.txt file at the root of our project and the main.cpp in the src folder.

    ${SRCS_DIR}/main.cpp
    )

# ==---------------------------== #

# copy the LICENCE file to the build directory
configure_file(

    ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/LICENSE @ONLY
    )

# copy the README file to the build directory
configure_file(
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/README.md

add_executable( ${PROJECT_NAME} ${MAIN_SRCS} ) 

target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME}
    ${REQ_LIBRARIES}
    )

install(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME}
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}
    )

install(FILES
    ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/LICENSE
    DESTINATION ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}
    )

install(FILES
    ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/README.txt
    DESTINATION doc
    )
 
At this point, if you are using Visual Studio, you can open the project with Visual Studio using the File->Open->Cmake option but if you are using Xcode (on a mac), or another IDE on a *nix OS, or if you just wish to follow along using only the command line and your editor you need to preform one extra step; creating the "makefile".

To `create the makefile' all we have to do is to create a directory to host the build and tell CMake to make the makefile based on the settings it finds for our confugutation (the compiler we have, and the OS settings, etc., etc.).

$> cd <project folder>
$> mkdir bin
$> cd bin
$> cmake .. -G Unix Makefile

We now have to create a LICENSE and a Readme.md file at the root of our project. We will be using the BSD opensource license for this project and our Readme.md will be a model of simplicity.

A comand line calculator used for a tutorial.

We need to take a quick break and talk about how you interact with git; interaction with git is simple and straight-forward(ish) but it may seem a bit foriegn so a few quick notes should set you on the right path.

After every edit you COMMIT your changes to git.
        This can be one file at a time or two files in the case of a header/impl file change. I do both, if the change requires me to change both header and impl file I COMMIT both files at the same time but I strive to commit each change, not many at once.
It is good pratice to have a standard (tepmplate) commit style.
        I like to prefix my commit statements with the file(s) I am commiting.
        -e.g. "main.cpp: Fixed spelling error."

So, after you saved each file (License and the ReadMe) Visual studio should warn you that you have new commits to make. Make a comment -i.e. "Initial commit." and commit each. Once that is done we can now add our main program; add this in the src directory add/commit the file to the git repo (you should now have made three commits).
