 Tutorial 6: Ready, Set, Go!

Let's create a program.

Place the CMakeLists.txt file at the root of our project and the main.cpp in the src folder.
                ...
                |
                +------ CLI Calculator
                        |
                        +------ CMakeLists.txt
                        |
                        +------ src
                        |       |
                        |       ------- main.cpp
                        ...

At this point, if you are using Visual Studio, you can open the project with Visual Studio using the File->Open->Cmake option.

We now have to create a License and a ReadME file. We will be using the BSD opensource license for this project and our ReadME will be a model of simplicity.

We need to take a quick break and talk about how you interact with git; interaction with git is simple and straight-forward(ish) but it may seem a bit foriegn so a few quick notes should set you on the right path.

After every edit you COMMIT your changes to git.
        This can be one file at a time or two files in the case of a header/impl file change. I do both, if the change requires me to change both header and impl file I COMMIT both files at the same time but I strive to commit each change, not many at once.
It is good pratice to have a standard (tepmplate) commit style.
        I like to prefix my commit statements with the file(s) I am commiting.
        -e.g. "main.cpp: Fixed spelling error."

So, after you saved each file (License and the ReadMe) Visual studio should warn you that you have new commits to make. Make a comment -i.e. "Initial commit." and commit each. Once that is done we can now add our main program; add this in the src directory add/commit the file to the git repo (you should now have made three commits).
