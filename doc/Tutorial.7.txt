Tutorial 7: Choose or perish

In the last 6 tutorials we did a lot of basic setup but now we can finally focus on some doing some coding!

I mentioned that we'll pass arguments to our calculator and it will preform operations on them; this can be done many different ways and only a few methods will offer you the most flexablity when it comes time to add functionality later. Firstly, we need a method to parse out the arguments passed to our program so we can then do stuff. 

I am going to demonstrate a very simple method that we'll outgrow almost immediately. I will do this because this will be a great introduction into the C languages syntax.


int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    return 0;
} ///:~
