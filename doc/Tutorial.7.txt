Tutorial 7: Choose or perish

In the last 6 tutorials we did a lot of basic setup but now we can finally focus on some doing some coding!

I mentioned that we'll pass arguments to our calculator and it will preform operations on them; this can be done many different ways and only a few methods will offer you the most flexibility when it comes time to add functionality later. Firstly, we need a method to parse out the arguments passed to our program so we can then do stuff. 

I am going to demonstrate a very simple method that we'll outgrow almost immediately. In fact you may notice gross inefficiencies but I will do this because this will be a great introduction into how your thinking will evolve with the C based language(s).

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    return 0;
} ///:~

The following was taken from the Microsoft developers website.

Argument Definitions

The arguments in the prototype

      int main(int argc, const char *argv[]);

allow convenient command-line parsing of arguments and, optionally,
access to environment variables. The argument definitions are as
follows:

argc

    An integer that contains the count of arguments that follow in
    argv. The argc parameter is always greater than or equal to 1.

argv

    An array of null-terminated strings representing command-line
    arguments entered by the user of the program. By convention,
    argv[0] is the command with which the program is invoked, argv[1]
    is the first command-line argument, and so on, until argv[argc],
    which is always NULL. See Customizing Command Line Processing for
    information on suppressing command-line processing.


The first command-line argument is always argv[1].

NOTE:

    By convention, argv[0] is the command with which the program is
    invoked. However, it is possible to spawn a process using
    CreateProcess and if you use both the first and second arguments
    (lpApplicationName and lpCommandLine), argv[0] may not be the
    executable name; use GetModuleFileName to retrieve the executable
    name, and its fully-qualified path.
***

So what that means is that "argv[]" is an array (or list if you wish) and that means we can just iterate the list looking for items in each slot.

In the C based languages we use the FOR method for doing that. Here is what the FOR statement looks like:

for ( <COUNTER> ; <SCOPE> ; <INCRIMENT AMOUNT>) {
        <DO SOMETHING>
}

and since argv[] is essentally an "array" or "list of lists" (a "charcter string" is esentially a list of characters terminated with a NULL) we can access each piece and check it against something we're looking for. For example:

for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
    if (argv[i] && strlen(argv[i]) > 1) {
        if (argv[i][0] == '-' && argv[i][1] == 'a') {<DO SOMETHING>};
        if (argv[i][0] == '-' && argv[i][1] == 'b') {<DO SOMETHING>};
        if (argv[i][0] == '-' && argv[i][1] == 'c') {<DO SOMETHING>};
        if (argv[i][0] == '-' && argv[i][1] == 'd') {<DO SOMETHING>};
        // ...
    }
}

However, as you can probably see, this is terribly ineffecient.

The code above is a bad method for locating arguments because we'd have to search for every possible instance we'd want to support with our program. We need a more robust method for discovering what arguments have been passed to our program.

We are going to build a simple tokenizer / parser to handle the argument list.
