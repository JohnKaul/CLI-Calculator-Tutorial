## 01 - Git Installation

Head over to the Git website at https://git-scm.com/ and assuming you're on Windows you should see
a `Download X.XX.X for Windows` where the X's are version numbers (2.20.1 at time of writing).
Click the link and your download should start.


Find your download and start the installation, click next to the GPL.
Next you will see some options, have a quick look but you can click through to the next
screen. 
Here you will be asked to select an editor to use within Git Bash (`Bash` is a
Command Line Interface 0r CLI similar to the Windows DOS or Powershell windows).
Feel free to select another editor but VIM (the default) is integfrated right into 
the Bash shell and with just a few commands will provide a good workflow for quick 
text editing tasks within your shell session.

The next screen will ask where you want to use Git from, I suggest leaving the default
selection this way you can use Git in Powershell, Visual Studio etc rather than just Git Bash.

Leave the `Use the OpenSSL library` selected and click next. IN fact, you can click through 
the rest of the screens, these settings can be fined tuned once you get a better understanding
of how the Git system works.

You should now have one last screen with the README and an option to launch Git Bash, tick it
or use the desktop icon to fire it up for a look.
At the `$` (dollar sign) you can enter commands, type in `git version` and you should see
somethiong like `git version 2.20.1.windows.1`.

Git should bow be installed but if you have any trouble, the documentation on the Git site 
is excellent so have a dig around there for tips and more in depth tutorials etc.
